# Computer Science @ UBC

I'm actively working through a bachlors of science at the University of British Columbia! 
This degree is going to take a while, I'm getting sidetracked by the Co-op program and potentially going into honours.

Some of my favorite courses have been:
- CPSC 213, tought by Jorden Johnson -
    I had a decent understanding of systems going in, but this class definitely filled in lots of holes.
    Jordan is an excellent teacher, he has a way of explaining things.
    You can tell when listening to him that even though this is his hundredth time explaining this,
    he's still trying to figure out the best way to tell you so you completely understand.
- MATH 100, tought by Adam Martens -
    Adam might be the most engaging instructor I've ever had. I've never seen anyone explain anything like he did.
- ASTR 101, tought by Aaron Boley and Michelle Kunimoto -
    I love astronomy! These two made it super interesting, even though the course itself was really hard.
