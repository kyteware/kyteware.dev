# Guitar

I picked up guitar in the spring of 2024. 
I haven't done any lessons, I'm entirely self taught.
I attribute a lot of my success to playing trumpet in high school, that tought me a lot of music fundementals

Some of my favorite songs that I've learned are:
- Heartbeats - Jose Gonzalez
- Hero - Family of the Year
- Bloom - The Paper Kites
- Flowers in Your Hair - The Lumineers
